# Open GSA Redesign

Open.gsa.gov is the current developer portal for all GSA data, APIs, and code open to the public. This repo is where we will be managing development of the redesign of this portal.

This particular site is made for use with the [Federalist](https://github.com/18f/federalist) in mind.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/GSA/open-gsa-redesign/wiki) for more info related to this site including a product roadmap, personas, and guides.

## Running locally

This site is built using Jekyll for the file framework.

### Before you start

You will need to have the following installed on your machine before following the commands below:

* Ruby v2.2.2+, [Installation guides](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/)
* Bundler v1.12.3+, [Installation guides](http://bundler.io/v1.13/guides/using_bundler_in_application.html#getting-started---installing-bundler-and-bundle-init)

### Basic setup

1. Install Bundler `gem install bundler` and then install Jekyll and all dependencies `bundle install`.
2. Fork this repo.
2. Clone the repo you just forked.

### Running Jekyll

The preferred method for running Jekyll is with `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

Note that this method will rebuild the entire site every time you make a change to any file. If you want faster builds, you can use `bundle exec jekyll incrementalserve`, which comes with [some caveats](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/incremental-regeneration/), notably only changed files will be rebuilt. This means if you change a data file, HTML pages that use that data file won't be updated.
