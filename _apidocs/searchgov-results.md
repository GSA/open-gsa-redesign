## Overview

[Search.gov](https://search.gov/) is a service of the General Services Administration, providing search engine capability to federal agencies for their public websites. To learn more about Search.gov and how to set up your site for search, please review the [site launch guide](https://search.gov/get-started/site-launch-guide.html).

This API exposes all relevant Search.gov web results in a single JSON call.

## Getting Started

The endpoint is `https://api.gsa.gov/technology/searchgov/v2/results/i14y`. You must use https. 

You can find your access key in the [Search.gov Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites). On the left side navigation, select the "Activate" (`</>`) icon and then browse to the API Access Key page.

## Note about Web Results and Endpoints

The endpoint you use to retrieve web results through this API will depend on the method we used to index your content. If we don't yet have your content indexed, you won't see results in the API.
  
We can index content using your [XML sitemap](https://search.gov/indexing/sitemaps.html) (preferred) or we can also deploy a crawler in some cases.
  
Sites indexed via XML sitemaps or crawling will use the `/i14y` endpoint. The sample API calls below use this endpoint.

## API Description

## Parameters
  
  Three parameters are required: (1) `affiliate`, (2) `access_key`, and (3) `query`. All others are optional.

  * You can find your site handle on the Search.gov Admin Center Settings page.
  * Your access key is unique to your site handle so they must be paired properly to return results. If you have more than one search site set up, make sure you've selected the right one to get the right handle/key combination.
  * Replace `SEARCH_TERM_ENTERED_IN_YOUR_SEARCH_BOX` with the query entered by the searchers using your website's search box.
  * Preformatted request strings with your unique values are provided in the [Search.gov Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > Your Site > Activate > Search Results API Instructions. 

  | Parameters                      | Description
  | :--								| :--
  | affiliate (required)			| Site handle <br> Example: `affiliate=YOUR_SITE_HANDLE`
  |	access\_key (required)			| The key used to access the API <br> Example: `access_key=YOUR_UNIQUE_ACCESS_KEY_FROM_ADMIN_CENTER`
  | query (required)			    | Search term <br> Example: `query=SEARCH_TERM_ENTERED_IN_YOUR_SEARCH_BOX`
  | enable\_highlighting (optional) | Enables or disables the highlighting of keywords in the results. The default is 'true' so use 'false' to disable highlighting. The opening and closing highlighting characters are `<U+E000>` and `<U+E001>`, which both look like "ÓÄÅ". You can learn more about them [here](http://unicodesymbols.wikia.com/wiki/U%2BE000) and [here](http://unicodesymbols.wikia.com/wiki/U%2BE001) (external resources). Your team will determine how to display the characters, whether as bold, italics, or some other preferred highlighting style. <br> Example: `enable_highlighting=false`
  | limit (optional)                | Defines the number of results to return. The default is 20, but you can specify between 1 and 50 results. <br> Example: `limit=5`
  | offset (optional)               | Defines the number of results you want to skip from the first result. The offset is used for implementing pagination. The default is 0 and the maximum is 999. <br> Example: `offset=20`
  | sort\_by (optional)             | Allowed variables are date and relevance. The default sort is relevance. Add `sort_by=date` to sort by date.
  | sitelimit (optional)             | Limits the results to the subdomains and/or subfolders provided. Multiple values can be passed using a space-separated list. Example: `sitelimit=digital.gov/guides`. The values passed in the sitelimit must be in scope of the Domains list in the Search.gov Admin Center for your search site.

  Faceted search offers a set of filters people can use to narrow their results. We support filters for tags, audience, content type, file (MIME) type, and three custom use fields. To enable faceted search on your results page, use the parameters below. You must set `include_facets=true` for these parameters to be applied. For more context on how we index content into these fields, see our [metadata documentation](https://search.gov/indexing/metadata.html).

  Faceted search is available only through the /i14y endpoint. 

  | Parameters                      | Description
  | :--								| :--
  | include_facets      			| The default is `false`. To enable facet features, set this to `true` 
  | audience                        | Returns results that match any of the specified terms in the Audience field. Ex. `audience=students, policymakers` would return results with an audience of students **or** policymakers. Accepts a comma-separated list of strings. 
  | content_type                    | Returns results that match any of the specified terms in the Content Type field. Ex. `content_type=article, blog post` would return results with a content type of article **or** blog post. Accepts a comma-separated list of strings. 
  | created_since                   | Sets a lower bound for the `created` date. Date must be in ISO Format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  | created_until                   | Sets an upper bound for the `created` date. Date must be in ISO Format (YYYY-MM-DD).
  | mime_type                       | Returns results that match any of the specified terms in the mime_type field, which indicates the file type of the document. Ex. `mime_type=text/html, application/pdf` would return results with a MIME type of text/html **or** application/pdf. Accepts a comma-separated list of strings. [Read about common MIME types](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types).
  | searchgov_custom1               | Returns results that match any of the specified terms in the searchgov_custom1 field. Accepts a comma-separated list of strings.

## Expected Results

  Each item returns a unique set of fields. Each array will only have contents if there are results in that search feature matching the query.
  
  Before you begin: If you set up the Routed Query feature in the Search.gov Admin Center, you will need to set up some additional logic. If there's a match between the query and the Routed Query, we'll return only the `route_to` URL. Otherwise we'll return the full results set. See <a href="#rq">Routed Queries</a>.

  If you have `facets_enabled=true`, you will receive additional fields as noted below.

  * ### query
  
      We return the query to you for use in the results page display.

  * ### web:total

      Total number of results available.

  * ### web:next_offset

  * ### web:include_facets

## Routed Queries

If you have [Routed Queries](https://search.gov/admin-center/content/routed-queries.html) set up in your Admin Center, then any matching query terms will change the API response.

For instance, if you set the query `example`¬†to route to `https://www.search.gov`, then the expected response will be the following:

`{"route_to":"https://www.search.gov/"}`

To fully implement this, you will have to add logic that will process this response and redirect the user. A site-specific API call and javascript sample are available within the [Search.gov Admin Center](https://search.usa.gov/sites/) > Your Site > Activate > Search Results API Instructions.
