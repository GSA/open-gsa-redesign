## Overview

When Congress passes laws, federal agencies implement those laws through regulations. These regulations vary in subject, but include everything from ensuring water is safe to drink to setting health care standards. Regulations.gov is the place where users can find and comment on regulations. The APIs allow for users to find creative ways to present regulatory data. To learn more about the program visit the [About Us](https://www.regulations.gov/about) page.

## Terms of Participation

The eRulemaking post Application Programming Interface (API), informally referred to as the Comment API, is provided as a convenience to facilitate the bulk upload of comments from a number of different commenters. The use of the Comment API requires a key, which may be obtained through the [open GSA](https://open.gsa.gov/api/regulationsgov/#getting-started) website. 

By registering for, receiving and using a key to the Comment API, the key holder agrees to the following terms and conditions:

1. When developing interfaces for commenters who will submit comment language and/or attachments through the Comment API, the key holder will include in the interface:
      1. A link to the same [terms of participation](https://www.regulations.gov/user-notice) and [privacy notice](https://www.regulations.gov/privacy-notice) that users encounter on the comment form for Regulations.gov, and
      2. A link to the Federal Register notice or other specific document in Regulations.gov for which the key holder is collecting or facilitating comments to be delivered through the Comment API.

2. The key holder certifies that:
      1. I will only submit comments through the Comment API that it has gathered through lawful means and that, to the best of the key holderâ€™s knowledge, represent comments from real persons, and 
      2. It has not and will not submit comments of its own creation under fictitious or misappropriated identities or otherwise in violation of federal law.

3. The API key may be disabled if an API key holder is determined to have violated these Terms of Participation.

## Data Limitations

A recent [GAO report](https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-103181) expressed concerns over whether comment data is fully described to the public, including any limitations. Various aspects of the commenting process can create limitations for certain external users of public comment data and some data fields are managed solely by agencies. For agency-specific commenting practices, contact [eRulemaking@gsa.gov](mailto:eRulemaking@gsa.gov). The Open API Specification document has been updated with information on agency configurable fields. For convenience, the data is also provided below in a concise format:

  https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?filter[postedDate][ge]=2020-09-01&filter[postedDate][le]=2020-09-01&api_key=DEMO_KEY
  ```

* Search for a commentId: 
  ```
  https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?filter[searchTerm]=HHS-OCR-2018-0002-5313&api_key=DEMO_KEY
  ```

* Sort comments by posted date in asc: 
  ```
  https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?sort=postedDate&api_key=DEMO_KEY
  ```

* Sort comments by posted date in desc: 
  ```
  https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?sort=-postedDate&api_key=DEMO_KEY
  ```
  
* Retrieve all comments for a docket where number of comments is less than 5000:
  
  * Step 1: Get all documents for the docketId FAA-2018-1084: 
    ```
    https://api.regulations.gov/v4/documents?filter[docketId]=FAA-2018-1084&api_key=DEMO_KEY
    ```
    It returns two documents, FAA-2018-1084-0001 and FAA-2018-1084-0002. Each document metadata includes an objectId attribute.
  
  * Step 2: Get all comments for each document using objectId:
    ```
    https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?filter[commentOnId]=0900006483a6cba3&api_key=DEMO_KEY
    ```
    The above request returns a list of comments for document FAA-2018-1084-0001.
    
    Note: Step 2 should be repeated for FAA-2018-1084-0002 in the above example.

* Retrieve all comments for a docket where number of comments is greater than 5000:
  
  * Step 1: Get all documents for the docketId EOIR-2020-0003: 
    ```
    https://api.regulations.gov/v4/documents?filter[docketId]=EOIR-2020-0003&api_key=DEMO_KEY
    ```
    The above query returns five documents where four documents are Supporting & Related Material documents and one document is a Proposed Rule. Response for the above request includes an attribute objectId for each document and its set to 09000064846eebaf for the Proposed Rule, EOIR-2020-0003-0001.
      
  * Step 2: Get all comments for each document using objectId:
    ```
    https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?filter[commentOnId]=09000064846eebaf&api_key=DEMO_KEY
    ```
    The above request returns a list of comments for document EOIR-2020-0003-0001, the only Proposed Rule in the docket. 
    totalElements under meta attribute shows that this document has total 88,061 comments. 
    
    Note: Step 2 should be repeated for each document. 
    
  * Step 3: Page through the first set of 5000 documents:
    ```
    https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?filter[commentOnId]=09000064846eebaf&page[size]=250&page[number]=N&sort=lastModifiedDate,documentId&api_key=DEMO_KEY
    ```   
    The first 5000 documents can be retrieved using the query above and paging through the results where N is the page number between 1 and 20. 
    Please note we are sorting the results by lastModifiedDate to ensure we can filter our data by lastModifiedDate later.
    On the last page of this set, please note the lastModifiedDate of the last document. In our case, EOIR-2020-0003-5548 is the last document on page 20 and the lastModifiedDate attribute of the document is 2020-08-10T15:58:52Z. We will be filtering the data in the next step using this date.
    
  * Step 4: Page through the next set of 5000 documents:
    ```
    https://api.regulations.gov/v4/comments?filter[commentOnId]=09000064846eebaf&filter[lastModifiedDate][ge]=2020-08-10 11:58:52&page[size]=250&page[number]=N&sort=lastModifiedDate,documentId&api_key=DEMO_KEY
    ```
    The next 5000 documents can be retrieved using the query above and paging through the results where N is the page number between 1 and 20.
    
    The lastModifiedDate attribute of the last document in the first set (Step 3) was `2020-08-10T15:58:52Z`. This date translates to `2020-08-10 11:58:52` in Eastern time. Running the above query should return all documents where lastModifiedDate is greater than or equal to `2020-08-10T15:58:52Z`. Its important to note that we are running a "greater than or equal to" query to ensure we do not miss any documents where last modified date is `2020-08-10T15:58:52Z`.

    On the last page of this set, please note the lastModifiedDate of the last document and repeat.
   
    Note: Step 4 should be repeated for as many times as needed to retrieve all 88,061 comments.

## Frequently Asked Questions

#### I am not seeing all fields returned by v3/documents endpoint in v4/documents endpoint. How do I access this information?

Our v3 API had a single search endpoint which returned information about documents, comments and dockets. To streamline our data, we have split our search into three endpoints:
    
* Document Search
* Comment Search
* Docket Search

Further, some data that could be retrieved using search in v3 has now been moved under details endpoint. For example, you can retrieve RIN for a docket using /dockets/{docketId} endpoint. The rin is not returned by /documents endpoint anymore.

#### How do I get document status from the new `/documents` endpoint?

The new `/v4/documents` carries a withdrawn field. This is a boolean field. If set to true, the document is withdrawn otherwise itâ€™s a posted document.

#### There are strict pagination limits in v4. How do I retrieve all comments in a docket posted on the same day if the number of comments is greater than 2500?

We have added an example that shows how to retrieve more than 5000 comments on a docket. Please see the example section.

Please note the new parameter `lastModifiedDate` is in beta and may be removed when we have a permanent bulk download solution available.

#### I submitted a comment, but I am unable to find it on regs. What happened to my comment?

Comments created via API are not made available in Regulations.gov right away. Agencies need to approve before the newly created comment can be posted out to Regulations.gov.

#### I am seeing 400 errors from commenting API. What am I doing wrong?

#### What is DEMO_KEY api key?

As indicated by name, DEMO_KEY should only be used for demonstration purposes. We have added this api_key to our examples to make it easier for users to copy/paste the urls. It should not be used for anything more than exploring our APIs. 

#### What is the staging API url?

Users should be able to access our staging API at https://api-staging.regulations.gov. Please use this environment for testing purposes.

#### I have an API key. How many requests can I make per hour and how do I know I am about to reach my request limit?

Please review https://api.data.gov/docs/rate-limits/ for information on rate limits. Commenting API is restricted to 50 requests per minute with a secondary limit of 500 requests per hour.
  
#### Can I request rate limit increases for my keys? 

GSA may grant a rate limit increase on the GET keys for an indefinite period. Such requests must establish the need to justify the rate limit increases. Each submission will be reviewed and considered on a case-by-case basis. GSA is unable to increase the rate limits for POST API keys upon requests at this time. However, the current POST API key holders can request one additional key without going through the validation process again.
