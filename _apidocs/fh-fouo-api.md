## Overview

The Federal Hierarchy “For Official Use Only” (FOUO) API allows U.S. Government users to obtain Federal Organization details down to the office level. As part of this API, organization information for all levels (Departments/Sub-Tiers/Offices) is provided by default. 

**Note**: *The term “organization” as used in the Federal Hierarchy FOUO API denotes any Departments/Independent Agencies, Sub-Tiers, Offices, or major commands/sub-commands under the Department of Defense (DOD).*

This API can return both active and inactive organizations. The API supports pagination with a default of 10 records and a maximum of 100 records.

**API Version: v1.0**

## Getting Started

Get Opportunities API can be accessed from Production or Alpha environments via the following urls:

*Note: Please refer the examples below to format right request URLs.*

* Production URL: https://api.sam.gov/prod/federalorganizations/v1/
* Staging (Alpha) URL: https://api-alpha.sam.gov/prodlike/federalorganizations/v1


## Terms of Use

You are allowed to use the Federal Hierarchy FOUO API for internal, U.S. Government business purposes. You are not allowed to display or disseminate outside the U.S. Government any values received in a Federal Hierarchy FOUO API response unless that value is directly associated with a Federal award record.

For financial assistance awards only, you are allowed to use the awarding and funding Activity Address Codes (AACs) submitted in association with a financial assistance award to derive the respective Office Name, Sub-Tier Agency Code, Sub-Tier Agency Name, Department/Independent Agency Code, and Department/Independent Agency Name from the Federal Hierarchy FOUO API. You may publicly display and disseminate the awarding and funding AACs, and the five specified Federal Hierarchy FOUO API-derived values from those AACs, in connection with the financial assistance awards.
 
You may not use the Federal Hierarchy FOUO API to build out a public view of either the partial or complete Federal Hierarchy. You must use the Federal Hierarchy Public API if you wish to display or disseminate the public-facing Department and Sub-Tier information.
 
You agree to be bound by these Terms of Use when you submit a Federal Hierarchy FOUO API request as well as when you receive a Federal Hierarchy FOUO API response. Contact the GSA IAE Program Management Office at newsamtesting@gsa.gov if you have any questions about these Terms of Use.

## Authentication and API Keys
User of this API must provide an API key to use this FH API. API key must either be a system account API key or a personal API key. Request per day are limited based on the federal or non-federal or general roles. 

Note: 
* For production, users can request an API Key in their Profile under Account Details on https://sam.gov/
* For prodlike, users can request an API Key in their Profile under Account Details on https://alpha.sam.gov/


#### User Account API Key Creation
* Registered user can request for a public API on ‘Account Details’ page. This page can be accessed on Account Details page on SAM.gov
* User must enter account password on ‘Account Details’ page to view the API Key information. If an incorrect password is entered, an error will be returned.
* After the API Key is generated on ‘Account Details’ page, the API Key can be viewed on the Account Details page immediately. The API Key is visible until user navigates to a different page.
* If an error is encountered during the API Key generation/retrieval, then user will receive an error message and must try again.

#### Generating a System Account API Key
* Users registered with a government email address and have appropriate System Account Manager or System Account Admin role may request a system account for data access.
* If a user satisfies the above registration criteria they will be able to access the System Accounts widget from their Workspace page after logging in.
* The user can then select “Request System Account” from the widget and fill out the required sections with appropriate Contract Opportunities permissions.
* The requested system account will then need to be approved. After approval the user will be notified via email and they can also see the updated status in the System Account widget.
* The user can select ‘Go to System Accounts’ in the widget from their workspace and enter a new system account password.
* After setting up the password the user will see a new section for retrieving a system account API Key. The user must enter their password again to retrieve the key.
