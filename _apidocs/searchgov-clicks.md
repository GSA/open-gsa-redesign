### Click Tracking API Instructions

The click tracking API endpoint lets you send in click events, which allows you to see click data on your Admin Click Analytics page. We also use this click data to strengthen the search results algorithm for your site.

Read more about click tracking [here](https://search.gov/manual/clicks.html). This API uses the **post** method for click tracking.

## Getting Started

The endpoint is `https://api.gsa.gov/technology/searchgov/v2/clicks/`

Parameters include:
* url
* query
* affiliate
* position
* module_code
* access_key


A full example of this is 

`curl -i -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded" \
-H "Content-Length: 0" \
-A "user agent string" \
"https://api.gsa.gov/technology/searchgov/v2/clicks/?url=https://foo.gov/clicked&affiliate=<AFFILIATE_NAME>&access_key=<AFFILIATE_ACCESS_KEY>&module_code=BOOS&query=test%20query&position=1"`
